== Architecture Constraints

In the next paragraphs, we set forth the constraints in a tabular format. By reading the table, you will be able to see the constraint itself, a brief explanation describing the main details and an alphanumeric identifier describing the constraint type.

At the end of this section, there is a table legend describing the different types of the constraints that we must deal with.
