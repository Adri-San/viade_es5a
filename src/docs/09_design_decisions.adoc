== Design Decisions

Work in progress..

In this section we will talk about the design decisions made to implement our routes application.

* For the project interface, we are going to use Bootstrap libraries along with Solid React components and PrimeReact.

* Programming language: we will use JavaScript together with ReactJS libraries, all using the Node.js framework.

* Data storage: the data storage will be done through POD's implementations and through use of RDF/Turtle.

* Object/Turtle: All the information used by the application will be from the data model defined in section 8.1. Domain Model. To store the information in the POD, it will use a JS object to Turtle file mapper and vice versa. 

* Testing: we will use unit test to business logic (Jest) and Cucumber for aceptance tests.
