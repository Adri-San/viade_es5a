== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
In this section we will talk about the design decisions made to implement our routes application.

* For the project interface, we are going to use Bootstrap libraries along with solid react components.

* Programming language: we will use JavaScript together with ReactJs libraries, all using the Node.js framework.

* Data storage: the data storage will be done through PODS implementations and through use of RDF.

* Testing: to test the proect, in addition to performing unit test, we will use Cucumber for acceptance tests.
