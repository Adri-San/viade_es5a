== Design Decisions

Work in progress..

[role="arc42help"]
****
In this section we will talk about the design decisions made to implement our routes application.

* For the project interface, we are going to use Bootstrap libraries along with solid react components.

* Programming language: we will use JavaScript together with ReactJs libraries, all using the Node.js framework.

* Data storage: the data storage will be done through PODS implementations and through use of RDF.

* Testing: we will use unit test to business logic, selenium for web usability and Cucumber for aceptance tests.
