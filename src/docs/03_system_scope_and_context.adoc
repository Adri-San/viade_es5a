== System Scope and Context

The system must be a web application based on the new technology called SOLID. This must be a system that allows you to upload and share routes with friends. 

The main advantage of this system is to avoid storing personal information in a external server. The user is the owner of their information and decides with whom to share it. It allows us to have a clear separation between the data and the application because the information is stored in a POD, which is unique for each user, and allows to store their information inside it. This provides us privacy, security and guarantees.

The following information must be allowed to be stored:

* *Routes (ttl)*
* *Milestones (ttl)*
* *Comments*
* *Images*
* *Videos*
* *Plain text*

The information exchange will be done by typing in the POD of the user logged in. If you want to share some information, the other user will be given permission to read only the recurring information.

=== Business Context

The different users in the software product we are dealing with are the following: 

* *Anonymous user*
* *Logged user*
* *Friend user*

In addition, we have the following services involved in the system:

* *POD*
* *POD Server*: Composite of PODs
* *Google Maps*

=== Technical Context

The implementation of the system should be done using the React framework that provides the developer the facility to design a usable web page for the user. This will allow to create a path storing milestones, images and videos.

The processing of the files must be done using RDF, a system that SOLID is compatible with. The information will be treated and processed in the client and will be sent to the server where it will be stored. If any information is received, this action will be carried out in the opposite direction.

Solid's POD server will allow us to store the information in our POD, and access the information in the PODs where the user has permissions. 

For the representation of the routes, Google Maps API will be used. It corresponds to the most advanced and used map-related service.

On the other hand, all communication in the application should be through HTTPS using TLS. It is necessary that all TLS requirements that this implies are met, as well as having a valid certificate.
